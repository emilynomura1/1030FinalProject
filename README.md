## Star Rating Classification of Yelp Businesses

This is the repository for my DATA 1030 midterm project using the Yelp business dataset.
The Jupyter Notebook used to clean, split, and preprocess the data can be found in the src folder. 
Relevant figures have been saved in the Figures folder and the .zip file of the data files necessary can be found in the Data folder.
Alternatively, one can download the Yelp business dataset from the [Yelp Open dataset website](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).
A JSON to CSV converter can be found on the [Yelp Dataset Github](https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples).

In order to save time and avoid data rate limit errors in Jupyter Notebook, the cleaned data should be read in rather than the raw data.
If it is necessary to read in the raw CSV data and execute the data cleaning steps again, one should specify the data rate limit when opening Jupyter Notebook from Terminal. More specific details relating to this issue can be found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43288550/iopub-data-rate-exceeded-in-jupyter-notebook-when-viewing-image).
